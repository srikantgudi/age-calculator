## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
```
- The age is calculated using the `reactive` feature of Svelte. Hence, the difference is immediately visible.
- Input type = `number` is used by setting the `min` and `max` values.
- Max value of year is calulated initially.
```
